This program creates a 3D visualization of a dynamic network of nodes and links, rendered in the Processing environment. It features nodes distributed in a spherical shape and linked by edges based on the Gabriel Graph algorithm, where two nodes are connected if no other node is within the circle whose diameter is the distance between them. The program allows for smooth 3D rotation of the network, with nodes appearing to move in 3D space, and links connecting them in real-time.

The scene is enhanced with a glowing particle effect, where particles move in 3D space, creating a visual "electric" feel. These particles are randomly generated and continuously updated, with new ones appearing in each frame. The visual elements are made more appealing through color gradients based on the spatial arrangement of nodes and links, alongside a rotating spherical wireframe background.

Additionally, the program includes text displaying an event heading ("TechFest 2024") on the rotating sphere. As the frame count progresses, the program continuously generates links, updating the visualization in each frame until all possible links are created. The program employs a combination of 3D transformations, particle physics, and graphical algorithms to create a visually captivating and interactive experience.
